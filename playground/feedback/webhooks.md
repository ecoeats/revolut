# Tests for accounts messages on sandbox

I created a script to test webhooks functionalities against sandbox. The ran operations could be found [here](https://github.com/feliun/revolut/blob/master/playground/testWebhooks.js);

The `setup` operation failed with the following error:

```
500 - {"message":"Oops! An error occurred while processing your request. It has been logged for further investigation. Error Id: 374d6aab-d4a4-4d2c-bcf9-6b8850a47bd7"}
```

I'm not sure what the requirement to setup a webhook is.
